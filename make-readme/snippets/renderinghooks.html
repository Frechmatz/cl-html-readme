Rendering hooks provide a means to add custom attributes to the HTML output.
A hook is a function that is called with the properties of the (typically) current DSL
special form and returns a property list containing the additional attributes.
Attribute names are represented by keywords. Attributes are omitted from rendering
in the following cases:
<ul>
  <li>The attribute name is not a keyword</li>
  <li>The attribute value is not a string</li>
  <li>The attribute value is an empty string</li>
</ul>
In the case of multiple occurences of an attribute the last one that is eligable for rendering wins.

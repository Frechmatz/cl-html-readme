The DSL (Domain Specific Language) of cl-html-readme is used to declare an
HTML skeleton consisting of semantic elements, heading elements and a table of contents placeholder. The actual "content" are plain strings that are embedded into this skeleton. These strings are not parsed during the HTML generation but written "as is".

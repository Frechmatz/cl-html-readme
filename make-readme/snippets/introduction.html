This library provides a means to generate HTML documentation for Common Lisp projects that are using HTML
as markup language for their documentation strings.
<p>The goal of this library is to make it easy to generate a table of contents or
  to structure the documentation with semantic elements. It shall not impose any styling. To accomplish this, the library provides a DSL as well as a couple of helper functions.</p>
<p>The general concept is to declare an HTML skeleton using the DSL of cl-html-readme and
  to provide the actual documentation and any arbitrary markup as plain HTML strings embedded
  into it.</p>
<p>The key features of cl-html-readme are
    <ul>
	<li>Generate HTML heading and semantic elements.</li>
	<li>Generate a Table of contents. Provide full control of what should be part of it.</li>
	<li>Easily embed source code files as well as HTML files.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

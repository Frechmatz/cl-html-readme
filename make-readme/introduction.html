Generate HTML documentation for Common Lisp projects.
<p>This library implements a simple HTML focused approach:
  (1) declare an HTML skeleton using the DSL of cl-html-readme and
    (2) provide the actual documentation and any arbitrary markup as embedded HTML strings.</p>
<p>Key features of cl-html-readme are:
    <ul>
	<li>Generate HTML heading and semantic elements.</li>
	<li>Generate a Table Of Contents. Provide full control of what should be listed in it.</li>
	<li>Easily embed source code files as well as text/html files via helper
	  functions provided by the API.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>Extraction of metadata such as documentation strings is not in the scope of this library.
    It is up to the documentation generation process of the specific project to implement
    metadata access as well as HTML rendering of this data.

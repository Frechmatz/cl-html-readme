Readme generation utilities for my Common Lisp projects. The key concepts are as follows:
<ul>
    <li>Readmes are using HTML as markup language.</li>
    <li>Docstrings are using HTML as markup language.</li>
    <li>Verbatim HTML output via plain hard coded strings.</li>
</ul>
<p>The library provides a DSL for generation of HTML headings, a Table Of Contents and HTML semantic elements.</p>

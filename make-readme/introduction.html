Generate HTML documentation for Common Lisp projects.
<p>The goal of this library is to support in handling of basic stuff like Table Of Contents,
  embedded source code or heading indentation levels. Giving documentation
  a personal touch like styling via CSS or using JavaScript shall be straight forward.</p>
<p>This library comes to its full potential, when Lisp documentation strings are
  using HTML as markup language. However, extraction of such metadata is not in the
  scope of cl-html-readme. It is up to the documentation generation code of the specific
  project to provide it as well as to render it to HTML.
</p>
<p>The general idea is to declare an HTML skeleton using the DSL of cl-html-readme and
  to provide the actual documentation and any arbitrary markup as plain HTML strings embedded
  into this skeleton.</p>
<p>The key features of cl-html-readme are:
    <ul>
	<li>Generate HTML heading and semantic elements.</li>
	<li>Generate a Table Of Contents. Provide full control of what should be listed in it.</li>
	<li>Easily embed source code files as well as text/html files via helper
	  functions provided by the API.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

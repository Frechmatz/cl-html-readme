Readme generation utilities for my Common Lisp projects. The key concepts of this library are as follows:
<ul>
    <li>Readmes are using HTML as markup language.</li>
    <li>Documentation strings are supposed to use HTML as markup language.</li>
    <li>The library provides a DSL for generation of HTML headings and a Table Of Contents.</li>
    <li>The library does not wrap functionality that is provided by the Common Lisp standard library, such as
	getting the documentation string of a function.</li>
    <li>Verbatim HTML output via plain hard coded strings.</li>
</ul>

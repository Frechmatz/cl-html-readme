Generate HTML documentation for Common Lisp projects.
<p>The library follows a very simple approach: (1) declare a HTML skeleton using the DSL of cl-html-readme and (2) provide the actual "content" via plain HTML strings.</p>
<p>The key features of cl-html-readme are:
    <ul>
	<li>Generate HTML heading and semantic elements.</li>
	<li>Generate a Table Of Contents. Provide full control of what should be listed in it.</li>
	<li>Easily embed source code files as well as verbatim text files via helper functions provided by the API.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>Extraction of metadata such as documentation strings is not in the scope of this library.
    It is up to the documentation generation process of the specific project to implement
    metadata access as well as HTML rendering of this data.

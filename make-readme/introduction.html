Readme generation utilities for my Common Lisp projects. The key concepts are as follows:
<ul>
    <li>Readmes are using HTML as markup language. A project has a readme.md that links to github.io where the HTML documentation is hosted.</li>
    <li>Docstrings are using HTML as markup language.</li>
    <li>Verbatim HTML output via plain hard coded strings.</li>
    <li>This library provides a DSL for generation of HTML headings, a Table Of Contents and HTML semantic elements, as well as a couple of helper functions such as reading code and verbatim HTML files.</li>
    <li>This library does not provide functionality such as getting the docstring of a function.</li>
</ul>

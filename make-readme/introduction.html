Readme generation utilities for my Common Lisp projects.</br>
<p>
  A Readme file in markdown format is created in two steps:
  <ol>
    <li>Generate an HTML file using the cl-readme package. Lisp documentation strings are supposed
      to use HTML as markup language. This package uses SBCL extensions for the generation of lambda list strings.</li>
    <li>Convert the HTML file to markdown using the JavaScript "turndown" library.</li>
  </ol>
</p>

The following example shows how the documentation of this library is generated. It uses
the <a href="https://github.com/eudoxia0/docparser">docparser</a> library.

One might ask, all these helper functions, why are they not part of the library? The reason is, that they are opinionated. Which library to use to retrieve metadata,
how to render a function and so on. The actual code is simple, kind of copy/paste stuff. Additionally, providing such functionality would result in perhaps unwanted dependencies.
